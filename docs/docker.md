What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a "container." Containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent across different environments, making it easier to develop, ship, and run applications.

Key Concepts
Images: An image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

Containers: A container is a runtime instance of an image. While images are read-only, containers can be started, stopped, moved, and deleted. Each container is an isolated, secure application platform.

Dockerfile: A text file that contains a list of commands that Docker uses to build an image. It specifies the base image to use, the application code to copy, and the commands to run inside the container.

docker-compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With a docker-compose.yml file, you can define all the services your application needs, and docker-compose will start and run them together.

How Your Docker Setup Works
Backend Dockerfile: Defines how to build the backend service image.
Frontend Dockerfile: Defines how to build the frontend service image.
docker-compose.yml: Defines and orchestrates both the backend and frontend services.
Steps to Run Your Project
Write Dockerfiles: You have separate Dockerfiles for the backend and frontend. These files define the environment and commands to set up your backend and frontend services.

Write docker-compose.yml: This file describes how to run both services together.

Build and Run Containers: Use Docker Compose to build the images and run the containers.

Detailed Walkthrough
Backend Dockerfile
This Dockerfile sets up the backend:

FROM python:3.9-slim: Use the slim version of Python 3.9 as the base image.
WORKDIR /app: Set the working directory inside the container to /app.
COPY requirements.txt .: Copy the requirements.txt file to the working directory.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt: Install the Python dependencies.
COPY . .: Copy all files from the current directory to the working directory inside the container.
EXPOSE 5000: Expose port 5000 (default for Flask apps).
CMD ["python", "run.py"]: Command to run the application.
Frontend Dockerfile
This Dockerfile sets up the frontend:

FROM node:14-alpine: Use the Alpine version of Node.js 14 as the base image.
WORKDIR /app: Set the working directory inside the container to /app.
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./: Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files.
RUN npm install: Install the Node.js dependencies.
COPY . .: Copy all files from the current directory to the working directory inside the container.
RUN npm run build: Build the frontend application.
EXPOSE 3000: Expose port 3000 (default for many React apps).
CMD ["npm", "start"]: Command to run the application.
docker-compose.yml
This file orchestrates both services:

version: '3.8': Specify the version of the Compose file format.
services: Define the services to run.
backend: Define the backend service.
build: Specify the build context (backend directory).
ports: Map container port 5000 to host port 5000.
volumes: Mount the backend directory to the container for live code updates.
environment: Set environment variables.
frontend: Define the frontend service.
build: Specify the build context (frontend directory).
ports: Map container port 3000 to host port 3000.
volumes: Mount the frontend directory to the container for live code updates.
environment: Set environment variables.
Running the Project
Navigate to your project directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project where the docker-compose.yml file is located.

Build and start the containers: Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
docker-compose up starts and runs the containers.
--build forces the rebuild of the Docker images.
Access your application:

Backend: Accessible at http://localhost:5000
Frontend: Accessible at http://localhost:3000
